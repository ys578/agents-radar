---

## 5. Community Momentum & Maturity

### High Momentum (Rapid iteration, growing communities)
- **DeepSeek TUI** — Most aggressive bug-fix velocity this digest. 7 PRs merged in 24h targeting core stability (sub-agent fanout, TUI freezes). Community is active despite smaller scale (24-comment cache threads). High energy around v0.8.66 release.
- **Qwen Code** — 43+ issues and 50 PRs updated. Major infrastructure push (daemon-managed channels, session archives). Windows advisory shows transparency. Strong Chinese developer engagement.
- **Pi** — Strong community participation (42 comments on scroll bug). Active stream-resilience and extension lifecycle improvements. Core contributor *mitsuhiko* driving quality features.

### Stable Mature Communities
- **Claude Code** — Largest community by raw engagement (494 👍, 89-comment threads). Enterprise adoption driving org-level features. However, long-standing bugs (tabs-to-spaces, API false positives) erode trust. PR velocity remains high but quality regressions are accumulating.
- **OpenAI Codex** — Second-largest community (664 👍). Desktop app focus driving requests. Alpha release cadence suggests pre-1.0 instability (Responses-Lite header breakage). Strong engineering investment in User Message Queue infrastructure.

### Established with Emerging Challenges
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — Stable v1.0.x releases but recent regression cluster (hooks broken, OOM daemon, BYOK fragility) suggests testing coverage gaps. Lower PR velocity (1 PR today) may reflect stabilization phase.
- **OpenCode** — V2 branch refactoring (core layers private, legacy config dropped) suggests major architectural shift. 90-upvote model fallback request shows unmet demand. 15+ question tool issues being fixed simultaneously indicates technical debt accumulation.

### Low Activity / Niche
- **Kimi Code CLI** — Near-zero activity (1 issue, 2 PRs). Critical OAuth bug unaddressed. May be deprioritizing the CLI in favor of other products.

## 6. Trend Signals

### For Developers: What to Watch

1. **Linux Desktop is the Unserved Opportunity**
   - Claude Code (494👍) and OpenAI Codex (664👍) have the strongest demand signals. No tool ships a native Linux desktop build. For developers building on Linux, this remains the single biggest blocker for adoption of these tools.

2. **Subagent Reliability is the New Frontier**
   - Every tool with subagent architecture (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, DeepSeek TUI) is wrestling with zombie states, false success reports, and fanout freezes. The winners here will unlock autonomous multi-step workflows that current tools cannot reliably sustain.

3. **MCP/Plugin Ecosystems are Accelerating but Fragile**
   - All major tools now support MCP or plugin architectures, but quality is uneven: OAuth token races (OpenCode), path normalization failures (Claude Code, Gemini CLI), tool routing gaps (Kimi Code), and duplicate server processes (DeepSeek TUI). Expect consolidation around a few robust implementations.

4. **Cache Optimization is the Cost Battleground**
   - DeepSeek TUI's cache hit ratio debates (24 comments) and OpenCode's token consumption spikes point to a core tension: as context windows grow, efficient caching becomes critical for both cost and latency. Tools that nail this will win on total cost of ownership.

5. **Cross-Platform Parity is the Unresolved Tax**
   - Windows users face clipboard breakage (Copilot CLI), process leaks (Qwen Code), hook path issues (Claude Code), and OAuth failures (Copilot CLI). Linux users face no desktop builds, broken right-click paste, and Wayland failures. Only macOS receives first-class treatment. This creates a persistent support burden and fragments the developer experience.

6. **Security is Shifting from Theory to Practice**
   - Prompt injection sandbox escapes (Gemini CLI), symlink file disclosure (Claude Code), CI credential leaks (Gemini CLI), and OAuth token race conditions (OpenCode) are now being actively patched. The community is demanding and receiving real security hardening—not just promises.

7. **Enterprise Features are Converging**
   - Organization-level defaults (Claude Code), BYOK model support (Copilot CLI), Azure DevOps integration requests (OpenAI Codex), and private marketplace support (Claude Code) all point to the same signal: enterprises are adopting these tools and demanding admin controls, audit trails, and compliance features.

### For Tool Builders: Strategic Implications

- **Invest in Linux desktop parity** — The community signal is unambiguous. The first tool to ship a polished Linux desktop build will capture significant mindshare.
- **Fix subagent reliability before adding features** — Every tool with subagent architecture has a queue of zombie-state and false-success bugs. These erode trust in autonomous workflows, the primary value proposition.
- **Standardize on MCP but prioritize quality** — MCP support is table stakes, but the community is experiencing friction from half-baked implementations. Focus on OAuth flows, error reporting, and optional parameter handling.
- **Cache performance is the silent differentiator** — As token costs rise, cache hit ratio will separate premium tools from commodity ones. Invest in transparent cache metrics and tunable policies.

## Feature Request Trends

1. **Linux Desktop parity** — The #1 community ask by a large margin. Users want a native Linux build for Desktop, Dispatch, and Cowork (merged from issues #65697, #38129, #40149). The closure of #65697 without a solution has disappointed many.

2. **Custom modes & configurable behavior** — Users want to define custom Shift+Tab modes (e.g., "mentor", "review-only") with behavioral instructions in config files (#65013). Also: disabling prompt suggestions in the web/app interface (#66117).

3. **Terminal UX polish** — Cursor-shape escape sequences on vim mode change (#72506), right-click paste restoration (#66056), and better session-idle management to avoid killing long-running agents (#72472).

4. **Plugin ecosystem maturity** — Windows path normalization, cache sync documentation, and symlink security hardening are the top plugin/integration asks.

---

## Developer Pain Points

1. **Silent data corruption / loss** — Multiple high-severity issues: tabs-to-spaces conversion (#26996), 30-day transcript auto-deletion (#62476), and Cowork session data wiped by auto-update (#43719). Users expect opt-in for any destructive operation.

2. **False-positive API blocks** — Saying "hi" triggering a Usage Policy error (#60366) and Code Review blocking at $0 spend (#39678) erode trust in the tool's reliability pipeline.

3. **Platform fragmentation** — Linux users are consistently second-class: no desktop build, broken right-click paste, auto-update failures. Windows users face Cowork and hook path issues. macOS users hit desktop freezes and idle-reaper kills.

4. **Zombie state management** — Background tasks that appear "Running" forever (#60095), Cowork tasks that click but do nothing (#71780), and idle managers that kill active agent sessions (#72472) make long-running autonomous workflows unreliable.

5. **Configuration drift between environments** — VSCode extension ignores `claude` environment settings (#72261), worktree branch prefix preferences silently ignored (#63753), and path-based rules bypassed via symlinks (#71072) — users struggle with inconsistent behavior across editors and terminals.

# Gemini CLI Community Digest — 2026-07-01

## Today's Highlights

A new nightly release `v0.51.0-nightly.20260630` is out. The community is seeing active progress on critical agent reliability issues, including a fix for recursive reasoning loops (PR #28164) and a major patch for thought leakage in history (PR #27971). The most active bug reports center on subagent recovery misreporting success after hitting turn limits, and a new PR hardens file-write permissions to prevent sandbox escape under prompt injection.

## Releases

- **v0.51.0-nightly.20260630.gae0a3aa7b** — Automated nightly build. No manual changelog details beyond the automated version bump.  
  [Full Changelog](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/compare/v0.51.0-nightly.20260629.gae0a3aa7b...v0.51.0-nightly.20260630.gae0a3aa7b)

## Hot Issues

1. **#22323 — Subagent recovery after MAX_TURNS reported as GOAL success**  
   A `codebase_investigator` subagent that hits its turn limit still reports `status: "success"` and `Termination Reason: "GOAL"`, masking the interruption. **Why it matters:** This breaks observability and debugging of agent workflows. Highly active (8 comments, 2 👍).  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/22323)

2. **#24353 — Robust component level evaluations**  
   An EPIC for expanding behavioral eval tests — currently 76 tests across 6 Gemini models. **Why it matters:** Quality improvements directly depend on systematic evaluation infrastructure. 7 comments.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/24353)

3. **#22745 — Assess impact of AST-aware file reads, search, and mapping**  
   Investigating whether AST-aware tools reduce token noise and improve navigation precision. **Why it matters:** Could dramatically reduce turn count for codebase tasks. 7 comments, 1 👍.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/22745)

4. **#21409 — Generalist agent hangs**  
   The CLI hangs forever when deferring to the generalist agent for simple tasks like folder creation. Users work around it by instructing the model to avoid sub-agents. **Why it matters:** Blocking for anyone relying on sub-agent delegation. 7 comments, 8 👍 (highest 👍 count).  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/21409)

5. **#21968 — Gemini does not use skills and sub-agents enough**  
   Despite having custom skills (e.g., gradle, git), Gemini rarely invokes them autonomously. **Why it matters:** Undermines the value of user-defined agent configurations. 6 comments.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/21968)

6. **#26525 — Add deterministic redaction and reduce Auto Memory logging**  
   Auto Memory sends transcript content to the extraction model before redaction, and logs unredacted skill transcripts. **Why it matters:** Security/privacy vulnerability. 5 comments.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/26525)

7. **#26522 — Stop Auto Memory from retrying low-signal sessions indefinitely**  
   Low-signal sessions remain unprocessed and are repeatedly surfaced. **Why it matters:** Wastes model quota and CPU on noisy data. 5 comments.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/26522)

8. **#25166 — Shell command execution stuck with "Waiting input" after completion**  
   Simple commands hang after finishing, still showing active status. **Why it matters:** Directly blocks interactive workflows. 4 comments, 3 👍.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/25166)

9. **#21983 — Browser subagent fails in Wayland**  
   Browser agent terminates with `GOAL` but fails silently on Wayland. **Why it matters:** Linux Wayland users are blocked. 4 comments, 1 👍.  
   [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/21983)

10. **#22672 — Agent should stop/discourage destructive behavior**  
    Model occasionally uses `git reset --force` or dangerous DB commands when safer alternatives exist. **Why it matters:** Risk of data loss. 3 comments, 1 👍.  
    [Issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issue/22672)

## Key PR Progress

1. **#28164 — Limit recursive reasoning turns per request**

   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28164)

2. **#27971 — Strip thoughts from scrubbed history turns**  
   Fixes thought leakage where internal model monologues leak into plain-text history, confusing subsequent turns. **Impact:** Critical for quality of long-running sessions.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/27971)

3. **#28219 — Parse commented settings.json in memory bootstrap**  
   Allows the parent process to read comment-bearing `settings.json` without silent fallback to defaults. **Impact:** Fixes configuration surprises for users who use comments in JSON.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28219)

4. **#28099 — Show descriptive sandbox label in footer**  
   Replaces hardcoded "current process" with actual sandbox profile name on macOS. **Impact:** Better debuggability for sandboxed environments.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28099)

5. **#28096 — Drop late tool calls after SIGINT cancellation**  
   Prevents delayed tool-call chunks from executing after user cancellation. **Impact:** Stops "zombie" side effects after Ctrl+C.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28096)

6. **#28100 — Fix Disposables leaked by comma operators in VS Code extension**  
   Fixes two `context.subscriptions.push(...)` calls where JavaScript comma expressions caused half the disposables to be silently dropped. **Impact:** Memory/resource leak fix for IDE companion.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28100)

7. **#28089 — Implement MCP elicitation (form + url) capability**  
   Adds client support for MCP elicitation modes per the 2025-11-25 spec. **Impact:** Enables richer MCP tool interactions (e.g., forms, URL-based auth).  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28089)

8. **#28215 — Harden file-write scope: stop sandbox/auto-accept writes to .gemini and .gitconfig**  
   Prevents prompt-injection-based sandbox escape where the agent could modify its own config. **Impact:** Security hardening, especially for auto-accept workflows.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28215)

9. **#28053 — Defensive path resolution for @-prefixed files**  
   Fixes a production bug where tools like `read_file` fail on paths starting with `@`. **Impact:** Unblocks file operations in contexts where `@` is used.  
   [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28053)

10. **#28216 — Exclude transient CI credential files from workspace context**  
    Prevents `gha-creds-*.json` files from being included in workspace context. **Impact:** Security: stops leaking CI credentials into model context.  
    [PR](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/28216)

## Feature Request Trends

- **AST-aware codebase tools** — Multiple issues (e.g., #22745, #22746) push for AST-level file reads, search, and codebase mapping to reduce token usage and turn count.
- **MCP elicitation** — Ongoing work (PR #28089) to support form and URL-based MCP tool interactions as the protocol matures.
- **Caretaker Agent infrastructure** — Large PRs (#28015, #28163) building out webhook ingestion and triage worker services, indicating a push toward automated issue triage.
- **Subagent trajectory visibility** — Requests to expose subagent traces via `/chat share` (#22598) for debugging and evaluation.
- **Better self-awareness** — The agent should know its own hotkeys, CLI flags, and capabilities (#21432) to serve as a self-documenting assistant.

## Developer Pain Points

- **Agent hangs and infinite loops** — The top recurring frustration. Issues #21409 (generalist hangs), #25166 (shell command stuck), and #22465 (interactive prompt stuck) all describe the CLI becoming unresponsive. PR #28164 directly addresses this with a recursion limit.
- **Subagent reliability** — Subagents misreporting success after turn limits (#22323), ignoring permissions (#22093), and failing silently in Wayland (#21983) are frequent complaints.
- **Inconsistent tool/agent usage** — The agent rarely invoking custom skills (#21968) and generating temporary scripts in random directories (#23571) frustrates users who configure detailed skills.
- **Memory system quality** — Issues #26525, #26522, #26523, and #26516 document a cluster of Auto Memory bugs: indefinite retries, unredacted logging, invalid patch handling, and silent skips.
- **Security concerns** — Prompt injection risks (#28215), leaked CI credentials (#28216), and destructive git/DB commands (#22672) show growing attention to safety and sandboxing.

# GitHub Copilot CLI Community Digest — 2026-07-01

## Today's Highlights

Version 1.0.66 ships with Claude Opus 4.8 Fast support, a long-requested cursor fix for interactive sessions, and improved MCP header parsing. However, the community is grappling with a cluster of regressions around hooks, BYOK model switching, and an aggressive new `tgrep` indexer that can OOM monorepo hosts. A PR introducing AI-powered issue triage via GitHub Agentic Workflows has also been merged, promising faster label assignment.

## Releases

**v1.0.66** (2026-06-30) — [Release Link](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.66)

- **Non-blinking block cursor** during interactive sessions; terminal default cursor restored on exit
- **Model updates**: Added support for Claude Opus 4.8 Fast, deprecated Claude Opus 4.6 Fast
- **MCP improvements**: Add/edit form now accepts `Key: value` headers (HTTP-style)
- **LSP fix**: Prevents language servers from starting twice

## Hot Issues

1. **#3727** — [Regression: `userPromptSubmitted` hook `additionalContext` not injected into planner (v1.0.60+)](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3727)  
   *Why it matters*: Broke plugin-based context injection for users relying on custom hooks. Identified exact release boundary (v1.0.59 working → v1.0.60 broken). 6 comments, 0 upvotes but high severity for plugin developers.

2. **#3874** — [`preToolUse` agent hook denial not working](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3874)  
   *Why it matters*: Security-critical — hooks designed to block commands are being ignored entirely. 2 comments, reporter provided full reproduction config.

3. **#3982** — [Copilot CLI ignores `grant_types_supported` for OAuth MCP servers](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3982)  
   *Why it matters*: Forces `authorization_code` flow even when server only supports `client_credentials`, blocking enterprise MCP integration. New issue, no comments yet.

4. **#3976** — [Native `tgrep` indexer OOM-kills host on large monorepos](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3976)  
   *Why it matters*: New experiment `copilot_cli_tgrep` spawns an unbounded daemon that can exhaust memory on large repos. No memory cap. Triage label applied.

5. **#3983** — [Global instructions.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md documentation clarification](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3983)  
   *Why it matters*: Users confused about default behavior of global instruction files. Requests clear docs to avoid unintended agent behavior.

6. **#3978** — [Copilot CLI incorrectly reverts to previous model after BYOK switch](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3978)  
   *Why it matters*: Session resumes with old model after token exhaustion, ignoring BYOK config. Frustrates users paying for custom API keys.

7. **#3954** — [`explore` tool hardcodes model to `gpt-5.4-mini`](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3954)  
   *Why it matters*: Even when using custom/DeepSeek endpoints, the `explore` tool ignores configuration and passes the wrong model string, causing API failures.

8. **#3981** — [Clipboard copy broken while Copilot CLI is running (Windows)](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3981)  
   *Why it matters*: Blocks basic workflow — Ctrl+C shows confirmation but clipboard remains empty. Windows-specific regression.

9. **#3972** — [UI displays mouse movement characters as continuous stream](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3972)  
   *Why it matters*: Terminal rendering bug on first load makes CLI unusable until restart. Likely related to cursor handling changes in v1.0.66.

10. **#3977** — [Feature Request: Persist autopilot mode across interactive turns](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3977)  
    *Why it matters*: `--autopilot` flag only sets initial mode; session reverts after first task. Users want persistent autopilot for workflows requiring multiple turns.

## Key PR Progress

1. **#2587** [CLOSED] — [Add automated issue classification with GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/pull/2587)  
   *Description*: Merged. Automatically applies `area:` labels and `triage` tags via `gh-aw` AI workflow. Should improve issue triage speed for maintainers.

*Note: Only 1 PR was updated in the last 24h. The repository shows low PR velocity today.*

## Feature Request Trends

- **Persistent autopilot mode** (#3977): Users want `--autopilot` to persist across turns, not reset after first task.
- **Desktop notifications for CLI attention** (#2941): When copilot needs human input, a notification should pop — especially for multi-tasking developers.
- **Live terminal panels for extensions** (#3979): Extensions currently limited to scrolling text logs; requests for dashboard-like live panels for sub-agents.
- **Drag-and-drop file attach** (#3955): macOS regression where Finder drag-and-drop no longer attaches files to prompts.
- **Custom theme support** (#1504): 20 upvotes for user-created, shareable theme JSON files beyond basic theming.

## Developer Pain Points

- **BYOK / model switching fragility** (#3911, #3978): Users hit `null length` errors and unexpected model reverts. Frequent frustration with custom key workflows.
- **Hook/plugin regressions** (#3727, #3874): Two separate regressions in the v1.0.6x series break core hook functionality — context injection and denial support.
- **Memory safety concerns** (#3976): No upper bound on `tgrep` indexer daemon causes OOM on large monorepos. Urgent for teams using the experiment.
- **Windows-specific issues** (#3981, #3973): Clipboard breakage and MCP OAuth re-auth loop failures on Windows persist, indicating platform-specific testing gaps.
- **Networking / proxy friction** (#3948): `web_fetch` tool fails universally with `TypeError: fetch failed` despite working model access — suggests tool-internal networking issue.

# Kimi Code CLI Community Digest — 2026-07-01

## Today's Highlights
Activity remains moderate over the past 24 hours, with no new releases published. The community is watching a critical bug (#2480) where the "Approve for this session" permission flow breaks entirely on K2.7 Code, potentially blocking OAuth-based workflows. Two long-standing pull requests saw recent updates: a visual UI polish for user input clarity, and a newly merged feature to pass an initial prompt into shell interactive mode.

## Releases
No new releases in the last 24 hours. The current version remains **0.20.1**.

## Hot Issues

| Issue | Title | Why It Matters | Community Reaction |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| [#2480](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/issues/2480) | [bug] Approve for this session doesn't work | OAuth session approval is broken, preventing any consecutive tool/API calls within a session. Reader reports Darwin arm64. Critical for productivity. | 0 comments, 0 👍 — surprisingly low engagement for a blocking bug. |
| *(Only 1 issue updated in last 24h. No additional hot issues to report today.)* | | | |

## Key PR Progress

| PR | Title | Description | Status |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|
| [#1600](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/pull/1600) | feat(shell): highlight user input with bright blue and separator for better visibility | Adds `#007AFF` bright blue color to user echo text and a full-width separator line below each user input in `echo.py`. Improves readability of multi-turn conversations. | OPEN — last updated 2026-06-30, no merge yet. |
| [#2246](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/pull/2246) | feat(shell): add `--prompt-interactive` option | New CLI option `-P` / `--prompt-interactive` allows passing an initial prompt and then keeping the session open for follow-ups. Resolves #2240. | **CLOSED** — merged per latest update on 2026-06-30. |

*(Only 2 PRs updated in last 24h; all key items covered above.)*

## Feature Request Trends
Based on broader historical issue patterns (not solely last 24h):
- **Session-aware persistent mode** — users want a way to start a shell with a seed prompt and continue the conversation (#2240, delivered in #2246).
- **Visual chat parity** — demand for richer UI elements (colors, separators, message markers) to distinguish user vs. assistant output in terminal shells (#1600 style requests).
- **Streaming control** — requests for granular stop/resume and re-generation controls during long responses.

## Developer Pain Points
- **Session permission fragility** — the "Approve for this session" OAuth flow appears broken under K2.7 Code, which can halt all multi-step automation workflows.
- **UI/UX ambiguity** — without visual cues like colors or separators, developers report confusion when scrolling back through long shell histories. PR #1600 directly addresses this need.
- **Initial context injection missing** — until PR #2246 merged, users had no way to feed initial context into interactive mode without losing the session; this was a recurring ask across multiple issues.

# OpenCode Community Digest — 2026-07-01

## Today's Highlights

This edition marks a major UX overhaul for the **question tool**, with a sweeping PR closing 15+ issues that have frustrated users for months. Meanwhile, the **v2 branch** is alive with refactoring activity: core layers are being made private, legacy config filenames are being dropped, and CLI-based MCP management is arriving. A high-profile feature request for **native model fallback** continues to gather community momentum, while several users report concerning context-window regressions after the latest desktop update.

## Hot Issues

1. **[#7602 — Native Model Fallback / Failover Support](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/7602)** (OPEN, 27 comments, 👍90)  
   The top-voted feature request this quarter. The community wants automatic fallback between *different* models (e.g., "if GPT-5 rate-limits → retry with Claude"), not just same-model provider fallback. This is a blocker for production deployments relying on multiple model providers.

2. **[#1692 — Socket connection closed unexpectedly](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/1692)** (CLOSED, 35 comments, 👍19)  
   A long-running connection stability issue that accumulated substantial community debugging. The volume of comments suggests intermittent network-level failures in fetch() were hard to reproduce, even with verbose logging enabled.

3. **[#26508 — Refunds for the ZEN scam](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/26508)** (CLOSED, 14 comments, 👍2)  
   A charging/payment UX issue where users accidentally paid a third-party processor (ZEN) instead of the intended GO subscription. The UI flow reportedly misdirected clicks, leading to billing confusion. This highlights ongoing payment friction.

4. **[#34640 — MCP optional array fields materialized as empty arrays](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/34640)** (OPEN, 3 comments)  
   A subtle but critical MCP interoperability bug: omitted optional array parameters are sent as `[]`, triggering mutually-exclusive argument validation that the model never intended. Could break tools that use optional arrays for conditional behavior.

5. **[#33027 — MCP tools connected but not exposed to agent](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/33027)** (OPEN, 3 comments)  
   A disconnect between MCP protocol negotiation and agent tool registration. The MCP server connects successfully and lists tools, but the agent never sees them—suggesting a gap in the tool routing pipeline.

6. **[#34526 — V2 MCP OAuth: token refresh race across locations/processes](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/34526)** (CLOSED, 3 comments)  
   A concurrency hazard deferred from the initial V2 MCP OAuth implementation: tokens are stored per-location but refreshed globally, risking race conditions across processes. The team is tracking this for a follow-up fix.

7. **[#27661 — Home/End keys scroll message list instead of cursor](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/27661)** (OPEN, 5 comments, 👍6)  
   A fundamental terminal input ergonomics bug. In the input box, `Home`/`End` scroll the message list rather than moving the text cursor, making long-message editing painful. High impact for power users.

8. **[#33473 — OpenCode Go/Deepseek V4 flash: 25% usage consumed in one day](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/33473)** (OPEN, 3 comments)  
   A sudden spike in token consumption after upgrading to v1.17.8, with no cache hits reported. User is alarmed by rapid quota burn immediately after subscription renewal—potentially a caching regression.

9. **[#34599 — Context window filling significantly faster after v1.17.11 update](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/34599)** (CLOSED, 2 comments)  
   Post-update regression on macOS Apple Silicon: context compaction rarely triggers, and windows fill rapidly even in fresh sessions. If widespread, this is a serious usability regression.

10. **[#11367 — Long question tool makes opencode unusable](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/11367)** (OPEN, 3 comments)  
    A persistent layout issue: when a question overflows the terminal height, the answer input is hidden below the fold. Multiple duplicate issues (#23730, #22282, etc.) confirm this affects both TUI and WebUI users.

## Key PR Progress

1. **[#34116 — fix(app): question UI fixes and UX improvements](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34116)** (OPEN)  
   **The mega-fix**: closes 15 question-tool issues (#11014, #14924, #15186, #15896, #22282, #23515, #23730, #24020, #24109, #26849, #28956, #32791, #34411). Implements scrollable overlays, trimming fixes, shrinkable panes, and mobile viewport support. This is the highest-impact UI PR currently open.

2. **[#34660 — refactor: remove remaining default layer aliases](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34660)** (OPEN)  
   Part of the ongoing v2 core cleanup. Removes legacy `defaultLayer` aliases across the monorepo, migrating to explicit `layer`/`configLayer` helpers. Cleaner dependency injection for the 2.0 architecture.

3. **[#34619 — feat(plugin): support plugin-provided tools](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34619)** (OPEN)  
   Routes built-in shell/subagent tools through the V2 plugin tool registry, removes the `ApplicationTools` abstraction, and wires SDK-next plugin tool registration. Enables third-party plugins to contribute custom tools—a foundational extensibility change.

4. **[#34643 — feat(cli): add mcp list, add, auth, and logout commands](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34643)** (OPEN)  
   New `opencode mcp` subcommands for the v2 CLI: list configured servers, add new ones (local or remote), manage OAuth tokens, and logout. Essential for headless/server environments.

5. **[#33017 — feat(app): edit files directly in the app](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/33017)** (OPEN)  
   A long-requested feature: adds an edit mode to the Desktop app so users can tweak files directly, rather than always asking the AI. Includes save/cancel UX. This blurs the line between chat interface and code editor.

6. **[#34628 — feat(tui): show session status in prompt area](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34628)** (CLOSED)  
   When the sidebar is hidden, key session info (tokens, cost, MCP, LSP, branch, directory) was invisible. This PR adds that data inline to the prompt status line—a small but frequently requested convenience.

7. **[#34566 — feat(tui): background running subagents](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34566)** (OPEN)  
   Wires the experimental background-subagents endpoint to `Ctrl+B` in the V2 TUI. Lets users dispatch child tasks without blocking the main conversation—a productivity multiplier for complex sessions.

8. **[#34624 — refactor(core): remove infrastructure layer exports](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34624)** (CLOSED)  
   Makes database, event, git, process, and ripgrep implementation layers private. Part of the v2 isolation effort to enforce clear core boundaries.

9. **[#34626 — fix: MCP OAuth callback for remote/web deployments](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34626)** (CLOSED)  
   Fixes MCP OAuth when `opencode web` runs behind reverse proxies or in Docker. Without this fix, the OAuth redirect URI pointed to `127.0.0.1`, breaking remote browser flows.

10. **[#34650 — fix(core): drop legacy config filename](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/pull/34650)** (CLOSED)  
    Removes `config.json` from V2 config discovery. Only `opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc` are supported moving forward. Clean break from the legacy config format.

## Feature Request Trends

- **Model Routing & Economics**: The top trend is **intelligent model management**—fallback between different models (#7602), configurable `small_model` tasks (#34614), and cost control (#27463). Users want to route cheap tasks (commit messages, linting) to local models automatically.
- **Session & Context UX**: Strong demand for **inter-session sharing** (#34600), **interactive steering** for queued tasks (#19205), and **close confirmation** on Desktop (#27463). The pattern is "I want to control and persist my agent's work across sessions."
- **MCP Ecosystem Maturity**: Several requests center on making MCP tools more reliable—proper optional argument handling (#34640), tool exposure consistency (#33027), and OAuth concurrency fixes (#34526). The community is stress-testing the MCP integration.
- **Permission Workflow**: Users want to **edit the "always" permission pattern** before confirming (#24795), indicating that auto-generated patterns are often too broad or too narrow.

---

## Developer Pain Points

1. **Question Tool Overlays Are Broken**: This is the most-reported single UX issue, with 15+ duplicates. The question pane blocks context, is unscrollable, and hides answer inputs. The community is unified: "Please fix this immediately" (#22282).

2. **Context Window Regressions**: Two separate reports (#34599, #33473) cite sudden performance degradation after minor version bumps—context filling faster or quota burning faster. This suggests flaky compaction or caching logic in the 1.17.x releases.

3. **MCP Tooling Gaps**: Multiple issues report MCP tools that "connect but don't appear" or "send wrong default values." The protocol integration feels fragile, especially for complex tool schemas with optional arrays.

4. **Mobile/Web UI Lags Behind Desktop**: Scrolling, overflow, and overlay issues are duplicated across WebUI (#34411, #24020) and TUI (#23730), suggesting the mobile-responsive layout hasn't received the same attention as Desktop.

## Pi Community Digest — 2026-07-01

### 1. Today's Highlights
The community is heavily focused on **improving extension and tool execution lifecycle**, with a major PR landing to apply tool changes mid-run (PR #6176). Several critical bugs around **streaming resilience** and **OpenAI API error handling** are being actively patched. Additionally, a long-standing request for **`excludeFromContext` on custom messages** has moved to a pull request, promising better context window hygiene.

### 2. Releases
**No new releases** were published in the last 24 hours.

### 3. Hot Issues (10 Notable)

1.  **#5825: [CLOSED] Streaming markdown forces scroll to bottom**
    *   **Why it matters:** A high pain point for users who read faster than the agent types. The "clear on shrink" setting caused a full re-render that yanked the viewport away from the user.
    *   **Reaction:** 42 comments—highest engagement of the week. The fix involved disabling padding via PR #6169.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #5825)

2.  **#5654: [OPEN] Add `excludeFromContext` to custom messages**
    *   **Why it matters:** Enables developers to send UI-only messages (e.g., `/status`) that are persisted but don't pollute the LLM’s context window or cost.
    *   **Reaction:** Strong support (1 👍). Now in PR #5678 by core contributor *mitsuhiko*.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #5654)

3.  **#6019: [CLOSED] OpenAI Responses: mid-stream retryable error not retried**
    *   **Why it matters:** Even when OpenAI explicitly said "retry me", Pi gave up. This is a reliability regression for users on the Responses API.
    *   **Reaction:** 5 comments; fix merged to surface the error body better (PR #5832).
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6019)

4.  **#6103: [OPEN] OpenAI Responses API mislabels empty tool results as image**
    *   **Why it matters:** Extensions that return empty success (e.g., `replace` tool) get mislabeled as "(see attached image)", confusing the model and user.
    *   **Reaction:** 4 comments. Exposed by a third-party extension, but root cause is in core serialization.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6103)

5.  **#5463: [OPEN] Auto-compaction after final turn throws error**
    *   **Why it matters:** A brutal crash when the agent finishes speaking and compaction tries to run on an empty queue. Blocks clean session completion.
    *   **Reaction:** 5 👍—highly upvoted. Root cause identified in `agent-session.ts`.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #5463)

6.  **#6133: [CLOSED] ECONNRESET crash during streaming**
    *   **Why it matters:** An upstream TCP reset kills the entire Pi process instead of triggering a retry. Critical for long-running sessions.
    *   **Reaction:** The `undici` error escapes the SSE try/catch. Fix being tracked.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6133)

7.  **#6151: [OPEN] Support image_url content type (pass URL directly)**
    *   **Why it matters:** Currently, even remote URLs are base64-encoded locally before being sent, doubling bandwidth and latency.
    *   **Reaction:** 2 comments. A performance optimization for providers that support direct URL references.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6151)

8.  **#6181: [OPEN] Bash tool: misleading timeout error**
    *   **Why it matters:** Setting a timeout exceeding JavaScript's `setTimeout` limit (32-bit int) causes instant failure with a false "99999999 seconds" message.
    *   **Reaction:** New today, already tagged `inprogress`. A sharp edge for users with very long-running commands.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6181)

9.  **#6189: [CLOSED] Question example hangs with batched calls**
    *   **Why it matters:** The `question` example extension breaks under parallel execution. Highlights a missing `executionMode: sequential` requirement in extension documentation.
    *   **Reaction:** Rapid closure with a fix to the example.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6189)

10. **#6187: [CLOSED] Pi login hangs in WSL after Copilot auth**
    *   **Why it matters:** WSL users cannot complete authentication—the browser token exchange succeeds, but the terminal never receives confirmation.
    *   **Reaction:** A platform-specific blocker for Windows users.
    *   [Issue Link](earendil-works/pi Issue #6187)

### 4. Key PR Progress (10 Important)

1.  **#5678: Add excludeFromContext for custom messages (OPEN, inprogress)**
    *   **What:** Implements the high-demand feature from #5654, teaching compaction and branch summarization to skip flagged messages.
    *   **Impact:** Saves context tokens and reduces noise for UI-only interactions.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #5678)

2.  **#6176: Apply extension tool changes before the next provider request (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Fixes #6162. If an extension calls `pi.setActiveTools()` mid-run, the next LLM request sees the updated tool list immediately.
    *   **Impact:** Enables dynamic tool injection without waiting for the next user turn.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6176)

3.  **#6169: Disable padding for assistant messages (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Removes the forced bottom-padding on assistant messages, directly fixing the scroll-jank in #5825.
    *   **Impact:** Users can now scroll up while the agent is still generating without being forced back down.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6169)

4.  **#6182: Add redo support to editors (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Follows up on #959 to add `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / redo functionality to the TUI editors.
    *   **Impact:** Parity with standard text editing workflows inside Pi.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6182)

5.  **#6175: Emit session name changes to extensions (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Ensures extensions are notified when a session is renamed, preventing stale references.
    *   **Impact:** Better integration for extensions that index or display session metadata.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6175)

6.  **#6115: Add configurable chat padding (CLOSED, to-discuss)**
    *   **What:** *mitsuhiko* proposes a TUI-level flag to reduce/remove padding, responding to repeated Discord requests.
    *   **Impact:** Solves the aesthetic and accessibility complaints about wasted vertical space.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6115)

7.  **#5832: Surface provider HTTP error body instead of opaque SDK message (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Fixes #5763. When a proxy returns a 403 with a body (e.g., gateway rules), the error message now includes the body instead of a generic "UnknownError".
    *   **Impact:** Dramatically improves debuggability for enterprise/custom-provider setups.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #5832)

8.  **#6170: Avoid replaying historical inline images (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Stops re-sending base64 images from previous turns when rebuilding session history. Falls back to `[Image: ...]` labels.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces context window bloat and token costs significantly over long sessions.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6170)

9.  **#1737: Move cache breakpoints (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Optimizes prompt caching by marking both the final assistant `tool_use` block and the final user block with `cache_control`.
    *   **Impact:** Improves cache hit rates and reduces latency/cost across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google).
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #1737)

10. **#6178: Guard against undefined content in tool result messages (CLOSED)**
    *   **What:** Prevents a crash when an extension tool returns a result with `content: undefined`.
    *   **Impact:** A defensive fix that makes the SDK more resilient to malformed extension returns.
    *   [PR Link](earendil-works/pi PR #6178)

### 5. Feature Request Trends

- **Richer Context & Lifecycle Control:** The overwhelming trend is giving developers more control over *what* goes into the LLM context and *when*. Features like `excludeFromContext` (PR #5678), suppressing historical images (PR #6170), and dynamic tool injection (PR #6176) all point to a desire for finer-grained context management.
- **Better Multi-Turn & Batch Handling:** Multiple issues (#6189, #6180) highlight that extensions and built-in UIs struggle when the model emits multiple tool calls or skill blocks in a single turn. The community wants better support for sequential/parallel execution modes.
- **Platform & Provider Parity:** Bug reports continue to flow for niche providers (Xiaomi, Kimi, Scaleway) and specific platforms (WSL login, Azure model names). There is steady demand for first-class support across the full ecosystem.

### 6. Developer Pain Points

- **Stream Resilience:** The combination of `ECONNRESET` crashes (#6133) and unrecoverable mid-stream errors (#6019) is a top frustration. Developers running long unattended sessions cannot trust the agent to survive transient network blips.
- **Misleading Error Messages:** The bash timeout bug (#6181) and the opaque provider 403 errors (#5763/PR #5832) show that error surfaces are a recurring pain. The community is vocal about needing actionable, truthful error strings.
- **Extension Runtime Gotchas:** Silent no-ops in RPC mode (#6186), multi-line command parsing failures (#6172), and the lack of `reload` in recent versions (#6173) make extension development feel fragile. Developers want a more predictable execution contract.
- **Accessibility:** Issue #4687 on screen reader support, while closed, generated significant discussion about the TUI's heavy use of box-drawing characters. The configurable padding PR (#6115) is a direct response to visual clutter complaints.

## Feature Request Trends

- **Channel & daemon infrastructure** dominates: daemon-managed channel workers (#5976), group history backfill (#6064), explicit channel memory (#6050), and channel loop support (#5990) signal a major push toward persistent, multi-user agent workflows.
- **Subagent lifecycle governance** — multiple requests for plan-mode tool isolation (#6083), parallel execution limits (#5176), and approval-mode fixes (#6034) show the community wants finer-grained control over subagent behavior.
- **UI/UX polish** for TUI mouse support (#6053), mobile sidebar improvements (#6000), and session timeline rails (#6078) reflect growing usage of both terminal and web shell interfaces.

## Developer Pain Points

1. **Streaming timeout regressions** — #5975 highlights that v0.19.3 introduced intermittent 120s stream inactivity errors, breaking the core interaction loop. High-priority.
2. **Windows stability crisis** — #6067 aggregates process leaks, orphaned PowerShell processes, and memory pressure. Community advisory urges suspension of Windows usage.
3. **Config persistence bugs** — `/auth` changes not propagating (#5979), `timeout=0` semantics being broken (#6049), and per-project model config lacking (#6052) erode trust in settings management.
4. **Security vulnerabilities** — #6063 reports `simple-git` and `shell-quote` as critical npm audit findings requiring urgent dependency upgrades.
5. **Model compatibility regressions** — GLM-5.2 thinking text leaking (#6007) and duplicate vision endpoint ambiguity (#6069) show friction with third-party model providers.

No new releases in the last 24h. The team is actively preparing **v0.8.66** via PR #3826 (see below).

## Hot Issues

1. **[#1177] Extreme input cache miss rate** — 24 comments, open since May 8. The reporter compares DeepSeek TUI's cache hit rate (far below 95%) unfavorably to DeepSeek-Reasonix, calling this a critical performance gap. Community members across multiple Chinese/English threads (#1120, #1747, #1732) corroborate the problem. This is the #1 pain point by engagement.

2. **[#1120] Cache hit problems persist after claimed fixes** — 21 comments. A detailed bug report questioning whether v0.8.17 actually fixed the input_cache_miss bug. The reporter recommends systematic investigation beyond single-point patches.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/1120)

3. **[#743] Massive token consumption spike** — 13 comments. A user reports consuming 400M tokens in half a day, questioning why requests are so dense and each interaction exchanges excessive context. No resolution yet.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/743)

4. **[#3821] Session permanently damaged by tool output timeout** — Severity: High. Long approval dialog timeouts cause the agent to stop responding entirely, requiring a hard restart on WSL. The issue was filed today and is getting immediate attention.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/3821)

5. **[#3461] MCP duplicate server processes** — 9 comments, closed. CodeWhale spawns two MCP server processes from a single `mcp.json` entry; the orphan wastes 4MB RAM and shares a stdio pipe, so killing one kills both. Fixed in current candidate.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/3461)

6. **[#3819] MCP OAuth authentication UX broken** — Filed today. Stale tokens not auto-refreshed, silent errors, and foreground login timeouts make OAuth MCP servers nearly unusable. Community member `bevis-wong` provided detailed reproduction steps.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/3819)

7. **[#1425] Session hang on large-text processing with 10 sub-agents** — Analyzing a 3-million-character novel triggered 10 sub-agents, which all got stuck on `agent_wait` timeout. User observed that sub-agents appear as "Running" but never complete. Illustrates the high-fanout freeze problem now being fixed in v0.8.66.

8. **[#3800] Multi sub-agent fanout freezes the TUI** — The umbrella bug for v0.8.66 release blockers. Parent of 7 child issues (#3801–#3807) covering write-lock contention, channel backpressure, YOLO mode violations, and sidebar rendering. Now resolved via merged PRs.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/3800)

9. **[#1186] Typed persistent permission rules** — 10 comments. Feature request for execution policy rules scoped by tool name, command prefix, and workspace path with allow/deny/ask decisions. Community member `greyfreedom` provided a detailed design.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/1186)

10. **[#2300] Multi-model compatibility and provider docs** — 7 comments. A user-facing acceptance fixture to clarify provider routing between vllm and openai, model IDs, and Fleet loadout. Still open as a documentation gap.
    [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issue/2300)

## Key PR Progress

1. **[#3826] Prepare v0.8.66 release** — The release preparation PR bumps metadata, makes TUI approval events engine-authoritative, and rebuilds binaries. In review.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3826)

2. **[#3825] MCP env placeholder expansion** — Community contributor `h3c-hexin` adds `${VAR}` placeholder support in MCP stdio config, solving the secret-passing problem for API keys. Opened today.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3825)

3. **[#3824] Wildcard disallowed tool prefixes** — Also from `h3c-hexin`: now `disallowed_tools` supports prefix wildcards, enabling "block everything from this MCP server" patterns. Opened today.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3824)

4. **[#3823] Suppress console windows on Windows** — Community fix: stops flickering console windows from spawning for every child process (shell commands, MCP servers, hooks). Opened today.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3823)

5. **[#3816] Sub-agent persistence off write-lock hot path** — Moved JSON serialization and file writes out of the manager write-lock critical section, reducing fanout stalls. Merged.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3816)

6. **[#3815] Hide Hotbar until explicit opt-in** — Product decision: v0.8.66 ships Hotbar hidden by default; users must run `/hotbar on` or config explicitly. Merged.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3815)

7. **[#3814] Keep approval controls visible inline** — Fixed TUI modal text overflow that clipped the action row on short terminals. Now renders approval prompts as a scrollable section with a sticky footer. Merged.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3814)

8. **[#3813] Nonblocking sub-agent refresh events** — Changed `ListSubAgents` sends to nonblocking to prevent status storms from stalling the engine/TUI event loop. Merged.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3813)

9. **[#3812] Parallel agent launches** — Made `agent` tool calls support parallel dispatch, so 20 concurrent agents can launch in one batch instead of serially. Merged.
   [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3812)

10. **[#3820] Xiaomi MiMo token plan docs sync** — Community contribution documenting the new `mimo-v2.5-pro-ultraspeed` model endpoint, Token Plan key names, and Amsterdam region. Opened today.
    [Link](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/pull/3820)

## Feature Request Trends

The three dominant feature directions this week are:

1. **Cache optimization** — Multiple issues (#1177, #1120, #1747, #1732) all converge on the same ask: make input cache hit ratios competitive with DeepSeek-Reasonix (95%+). Users want systematic rather than patch-based fixes.

2. **Execution policy granularity** — Requests for typed permission rules (#1186), MCP OAuth lifecycle improvements (#3819), and wildcard tool disallowing (PR #3824) signal a push toward finer-grained, persistent security controls.

3. **Multi-model/provider routing** — Issues #2300, #2026, and PR #3820 show growing demand for clear model selection UI, Fleet loadout auto-detection, and documentation for non-DeepSeek providers like Xiaomi MiMo.

## Developer Pain Points

- **Token cost shock** — Users consistently report unexpectedly high token consumption (#743, #1818) during normal usage, with one report of 400M tokens in half a day. No clear resolution path exists.
- **Session unrecoverability** — High-severity bugs (#3821, #1425) where the TUI enters a permanently broken state requiring full restart. The team's v0.8.66 fixes (sub-agent fanout, modal overflow, YOLO authority) directly address these.
- **Documentation gaps** — The gap between provider configuration (`vllm` vs `openai`) and user-facing model selection remains confusing (#2300). Users also want clearer guidance on remote workbench setup for non-Tencent infrastructure (#1990).
